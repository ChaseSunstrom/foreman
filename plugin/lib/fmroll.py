"""T-1648: fm design roll. A seeded, coherent pick: one look card (plugin/skills/library/cards/looks) gives the palette
roles, type pair, motion and texture together, never a mix of cards; the seed picks the card, then which named face of
each type class leads its stack (the generic ones, Inter, Roboto, Arial, never lead and are dropped). --apply writes it
as DESIGN.md's ## Look section (the card's name beside the seed: a seed means another card once the cards change),
one patch: the file's exact bytes before the first roll go to an undo record and a plain .orig copy in the project's
state, and --undo puts them back (or removes a DESIGN.md the roll created) only while the file is what the last roll
wrote, or what was there before a roll that never landed. A symlinked DESIGN.md is refused. Stdlib only."""
