"""T-2369 (Mission 6, #5): a capability miss during an active task is that task's to resolve. The PostToolUseFailure hook
logs `capability_miss` (task, data name/kind/cmd); fm next leads with the open ones, and fm task finish (and done)
refuse the task while one is unresolved. A miss resolves only by run evidence, never by a typed line, a flag or a file
that happens to exist. Everything is read from the task's own ledger and brief, never from the global events:
  - `miss_resolved` (the PostToolUse hook logs it when a passing Bash command, in one of this task's own sessions and
    not a subagent, has the miss's key: the whole command, cd prefix and spacing aside),
  - a [ran] evidence line with exit 0 and that key, later than the miss (fm ran it; a typed line can't be one),
  - `fix_paired` (data failed, cmd: fmfixes paired a passing command with the failure, T-1032), only while the tool is
    present now, and never for a no-op command (touch, mkdir, true, :, test, [),
  - `tool_proved` (data name: a tool built and proved from runs),
  - `grant_queued` (data name, optional step: a grant asked for) plus a later passing [ran] run of that step.
A run counts only when strictly later than the miss (timestamps are whole seconds). The way out short of resolving is
fm task block with the diagnosis. No miss logged on the task: nothing here runs."""
