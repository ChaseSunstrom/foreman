"""T-2388 (Mission 7, #10): the incident ritual. `fm incident '<impact>' --signal CMD` runs the harm signal and opens an
urgent FIX only when it is red (exit 1..125; a 126/127, a timeout or a run that never reached its check is a broken
signal, not harm). The red run is the first evidence of criterion 1 ("the signal is green again"), the Timeline section
starts at the UTC time, and `fm incident log '<action>' --expect '<effect>'` adds a row. The close needs the same signal
green twice after the fix's last edit (both fm-run: the close's own run counts as one) and one captured follow-up
(`fm incident follow-up '<text>'`). The signal stays behind as criterion 1's passing run, and fm sentinel's re-verify queue
reads the incident's touched files as its scope, so a later commit touching them reruns it. The signal is stored on the
brief and runs through the guard like any verify, with credentials stripped from its environment; criterion 1 must still be
that command at the close (re-open the incident to change it)."""
