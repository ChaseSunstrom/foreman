"""fm check playbooks (T-1505): the playbook library's lint, for a library that grows by dozens of files a round.

Every file under references/ is named in SKILL.md or in its stage's INDEX.md (itself named in SKILL.md), every path an
index names exists, and SKILL.md stays inside doctor's budget. No two playbooks share a title or most of their words
(5-word shingles, Jaccard over DUP). Each has a Use-when line above its first section and a numbered procedure (a
line starting '1. ' outside code), and none grew past its ceiling in ratchet.json by more than SLACK (growth is said
out loud with `fm check playbooks ratchet`, which also lowers the ceiling of one that shrank; a new playbook has no
record yet and passes). Every `fm lib show NAME` is a card, and every python block not marked no-run
(```python no-run) exits 0 under python3 -I in an empty folder with stdin closed, PATH its only inherited variable,
limits on memory, processes and file size, and a timeout. reach() names the playbooks no session has read lately
(events.jsonl's Read events, as fm cost counts them, across every project: the playbooks are shared).

The blocks are trusted like the repo's tests: the folder, environment and limits are hygiene, not a sandbox. A block
can still read and write absolute paths, use the network and run any program on PATH, and a process it moves to its
own session (setsid) escapes the process-group kill.

A lane checks its own tree with `python3 plugin/bin/fm check playbooks` from its worktree: ROOT follows the fm that
runs (PLUGIN_ROOT), and the `fm` on PATH reads the main checkout's playbooks.

T-1621: `fm playbooks show NAME` is how the skill loads one: each {{fact}} (FACTS) filled in from fm map for the project
it runs in, an unknown or empty one left as {{fact?}}, and the project's .claude/playbooks/<stage>/<name>.md after it
under a 'This project' heading: beside the project's other Claude Code files, shared through git, and a place the guard
lets a session write (.foreman/ is fm's alone). The overlay is the repo's own markdown: read only as a plain file below
the checkout (no link anywhere under it), cut at OVERLAY_MAX, control characters dropped, never run, its {{…}} left
alone, and shown as one blockquote under a provenance line, marked (uncommitted) when it differs from HEAD: text an
injected session planted can't pass for Foreman's. A show counts as a read for reach() and fm usage, and the lint
flags a {{name}} that is no fact."""
