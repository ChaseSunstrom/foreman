"""T-2372 (Mission 6, #5): a tool built during a task (fm new tool, fm mcp new) proves itself before the task closes.
Both log `tool_built` on the active task (data name, need, kind, path, test). fm task finish and fm task done then
refuse the task until, for each tool, from the task's own ledger events and evidence (a typed line replaces none):
  - search: a `tool_search` receipt (fm which, on this task) for the tool's need, earlier in the ledger than the build,
  - red then green: the tool's test run by fm ([ran] evidence: the test's path in executable position), failing and
    later passing, and the newest run passing,
  - stub: in a scratch copy the test passes on the real tool and fails with the tool's body replaced by nothing (a
    hang is killed and counts as a failure, but not on the real tool: no verdict then),
  - use: a [ran] evidence line, strictly after the green run, exit 0, whose last command runs the tool (its path in
    executable position: `runs`), not --help and not its own test. Naming the file (cat, git add, py_compile) is no run.
All four hold: `tool_proved` {name, path, need} (fmmiss reads it as a resolved miss). A task that built nothing pays one
filtered ledger read. A broken ledger read fails open, like fmmiss; a tool that can't be checked (a file that can't be
read, a scratch run that can't start) is refused by name, never skipped.
ponytail: the scratch copy holds the tool and its test only (a stdlib script and its test: what the scaffolds make);
a test that needs a sibling file fails there with the real tool and is refused with that said. `runs` reads one
command: a newline, `||`, a trailing `&`, or a tool that isn't the last command is not a use; the first non-option
argument of an interpreter is the script (`python3 -W error x.py` isn't read: run `python3 x.py`)."""
