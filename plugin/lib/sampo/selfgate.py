"""T-2352: the self-change gate at fm lane merge. A branch that changes Sampo's own plugin/ merges only when it keeps
what the base has: the guard blocks no less (its labelled cases and allow-corpus, the union of base's and branch's so a
deleted case can't hide, plus recent real commands, judged with no grants by each tree's own guard), no hook gets
slower (the hooks of each tree on the base's bench), and the always-on footprint doesn't grow with no cut to pay for it
(T-2358's rule). The harness is always the base's (fmreplay.py, bench_hooks.py and its payloads), so a branch can't
rewrite the judge; trees are built from git's blobs, not git archive (whose .gitattributes a branch controls).
A refusal names the numbers. Only the user's yes to `fm ask ID core` given after a refusal of the same commit passes
it: never the standing yes, never a decision, never a yes for an earlier commit. A gate that can't run refuses with the
reason, and the same yes passes that too."""
