"""fm exam (T-2079): a seeded exam of throwaway repos in six languages. Each scenario plants one defect (bug, vuln,
untested, slow, docs, flaky, dep) or poses a request shape (vague, ambiguous, missing-tool, none, goal, resume) in a
small app rendered from one spec. The answer key, the hidden checks and the clean render sit beside the repo, never in it; a
third of each kind is held out by a hash of its id. Agents answer, the grader reads only key.json, scores go to the
Genesis tower's exam.jsonl."""
