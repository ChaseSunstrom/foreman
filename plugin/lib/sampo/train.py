"""T-3380: sampo lane train, a merge queue. Reviewed lanes merge one after another in a scratch integration worktree
(never the main checkout); the project's gates run once on the result; a red run names its culprit lanes from its own
output (T-3602: _blame), bisecting by prefix only what it can't pin on one lane, each probe the red gate alone on the
red classes alone; the culprits are dropped and a narrowed confirm run checks the rest; the main checkout's branch then
fast-forwards to the gated tip.
The train's check_run carries the code tree (core.code_tree: no CHANGELOG.md, no sync mirror), so `sampo check` after
each close reuses the pass while the code is unchanged. T-3544: the full-suite gate runs only the tests the batch's
changes reach (_affected_gate); the full suite then runs on the landed merges in the background (lanes.pm_run)."""
