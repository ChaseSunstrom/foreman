"""fm code (T-1212): Foreman's loop run by the harness, with a model filling small slots (Foreman Code, T-1207).

    fm code "<request>" [--model NAME] [--escalate NAME] [--max-steps 40] [--dry-plan] [--no-commit] [--json]
    fm code --resume [ID]          continue a run that crashed or was killed, from its journal
    fm code models                 the model profiles (fmmodels) and where each comes from
    fm code tui [REQUEST]          the same run in a terminal UI (fmcodetui, T-1283)
    fm code bench [--model P | --worker CLI] [--seeds a,b]   grade a model or CLI on seeded tasks (fmcodebench, T-1215)

The model never drives. It fills a PLAN slot ({type, tier S|M, title, criteria: [{text, verify}], steps}), checked
and repaired at most twice with the error quoted back; then, for each step, it picks one action at a time, as a native
tool call when its profile has tools, else a JSON object in its text ({"action": NAME, ...}):
  read {path, start?, lines?}   a file's numbered lines (or a folder's entries), inside the project
  search {pattern, glob?}       git grep -E, bounded
  edit {file, old, new}         the guard (PreToolUse Edit), then fm edit (all or nothing)
  write {file, content}         the guard (PreToolUse Write), then the file
  run {cmd}                     the guard (PreToolUse Bash), then bash at the root; output cut to head and tail
  done {summary}                the step is finished
The guard is reached exactly as other harnesses do: plugin/hooks/hook PreToolUse with a Claude-Code-shaped payload;
exit 2, a deny or an ask (nobody here to answer it) is a refusal, sent back as the action's result and never run.
The harness makes the task (fm task new --focus), runs each criterion's verify as evidence (fm task evidence --ac N
--run) before the first step and after the last, gives a failure back to the model (3 rounds, then 3 more on
--escalate's model), blocks the task when it still fails, and closes it with fm task finish (an M task's audit lenses,
docs and lesson come from one more slot). Every message and action goes in the project's code/<task>.jsonl journal.

    fm code "<request>" --worker CLI [--worker-timeout 1200] [--verify CMD]     (T-1214)
An installed CLI (WORKERS, or 'CMD {prompt}') does each step and fix round in one unattended turn instead of the model;
--verify plans without a model (one S task, done when CMD passes). After each turn the harness judges the tree: Git's
own config and hooks are put back, a commit is undone (its changes stay), and each changed file the guard refuses as a
Write is reverted and reported. The worker's exit code and reply never mark anything done: the harness's verify does.
