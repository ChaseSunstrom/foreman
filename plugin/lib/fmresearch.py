"""fm research ask (T-0206): web research as an engine, not one agent's word. What the project already knows comes
first (fm recall); the question is split into sub-questions (by a tool-less planner child, or --sub); each is researched
by its own `claude -p` child that can only search and fetch the web; every claim must cite a page and quote it; then
each cited page is fetched here and the quoted words are looked for, so a claim is marked verified, not found or
unchecked before anyone relies on it. One note goes to the project's research/ (recall finds it next time).

Only public https pages are fetched (every redirect re-checked), at most 3 MB each."""
