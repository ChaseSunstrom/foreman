# Foreman playbooks

On-demand procedures, ported with attribution from ECC (MIT; see `plugin/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`). Load only the one you need: `fm playbooks show PATH` adds this project's facts and its `.claude/playbooks/` overlay; before editing one, `fm playbooks eval PATH` scores the shipped text against its held-out briefs (`plugin/evals/playbooks/`), with and without it; `route STAGE`, `blame PATH` (lines to tasks), `preview PATH` (checks it adds); from this repo's work, `draft ID`, `mine` (files changed together), `counter` (what failed here); to learn, `score NAME --task ID`, `kata NAME [--answer FILE]`, `lesson RANGE` (a diff in five minutes). They supplement the Foreman loop and never override it: Foreman's evidence rule, `fm` state, the guard and the focus lock still apply. Where a playbook mentions an ECC agent, command, hook or script, use the Foreman equivalent: planning → `/foreman:intake`; review agents → `foreman:fm-reviewer` or the checklist itself; security review → `/security-review` plus `references/security/security-review.md`; TDD → `../intake/references/regression-test.md`; session save/resume → `fm checkpoint` / `/foreman:resume`.

Core debugging, regression-test and verification procedures live with intake: `../intake/references/debugging.md`, `../intake/references/regression-test.md`, `../intake/references/verification.md`.

## BASELINE / FIX — build and compile errors
- `references/build/INDEX.md` — build and compile errors per toolchain: C++, Rust, TypeScript, Go, JVM, Swift, C#, shell. `fm playbooks show` the index, then the one you need.

## Language references — idioms and testing
For one framework, library, service or tool, use the stack library instead: `fm lib` suggests this repo's cards, `fm lib show NAME --section verify` reads one part (`../library/SKILL.md`).
