"""fmguard.check stays fast on pathological commands (T-2668).

Each case builds one hostile command and times g.check in CPU seconds (process_time, so a loaded machine doesn't
flake). A case over its bar fails. The bars are set from a measured baseline with >= 5x headroom; the worst measured
time is printed. test_planted_quadratic_fails wires a catastrophic regex into the same harness to prove it can fail."""
