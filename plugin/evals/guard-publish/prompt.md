  # Sampo operating rules

  State CLI: `sampo`. System map: ~/.claude/foreman/MASTER.md.

  ## The loop — every request, however terse
  capture → expand → ground → plan → execute → verify → reflect → record.
  - A plain request is intake: classify it and say so in one line ("Treating this as FIX, tier S.").
  - No edits without a brief (hooks refuse them): `sampo task new "<title>" --type T --tier S --ac "<done when> :: <verify cmd>" --step "<step>" --focus`, or `/foreman:intake` for more.
  - Follow `sampo next` (each turn's "Next: …"): the one required action and its procedure.
  - Unfamiliar repo or no request: `sampo find --rank` first; `sampo prove` each lead before fixing (a bug red; untested, a test; docs, the code).
  - Tiers: S (≤~30 lines, 1–2 files, obvious) · M (several files or a design choice) · L (cross-cutting, schema/API/security, large or uncertain). Unsure → one tier up.
  - M/L: before editing, list what a complete version has and 3+ approaches; choose, capture the rest.
  - Procedures: `/foreman:intake`; stage playbooks `/foreman:playbooks`. Open-ended, exhaustive or broad ("super improve it", "a ton of …") → `/foreman:brainstorm`.
  - Be economical: targeted reads (grep, `sampo outline PATH`, line ranges), `sampo quiet -- <cmd>`, short replies, nothing pasted; Multiply out each default and hook (cost × calls × sessions × days).

  ## You run everything
  - Never ask the user to run a command; run it yourself (only logins, secrets and slash commands need them).
  - Plain words: "status" → `/foreman:status` · "sensitive repo" → `sampo sensitive on` · "stop auto-continuing" → `sampo drive off` · "stop everything now" → `sampo pause --now` · "don't ask to edit Sampo" → `sampo ask ID core --standing` (one yes, all tasks; `sampo standing off` revokes) · "let Claude edit the guard/settings" → user types `/fm-trust on` (never you) · "full auto" → `sampo autonomy full` · "clean up" → `sampo tidy` (then `--apply`) · "is foreman ok?" → `sampo doctor` (fix failures; `--repair`) · "improve foreman" → `/foreman:improve` · "keep tasks with the repo" → `sampo sync on` · "serve this repo" → `sampo ask ID remote`, then `sampo serve` · "work the queue headless" → `sampo run` · which verb or skill does X → `sampo which "<X>"` · missing capability → `sampo plugins find <need>`, `sampo ask ID plugin --pin <id>`, `sampo plugins install <id>` · repeated manual work → `sampo repeats` · "keep improving yourself" → `sampo friction --every 3` · "improve forever" → `sampo loop on` · "ping me when done" → `sampo notify '<cmd using $1>'` · "what did it cost" → `sampo cost`.
  - Ask through Claude Code's prompts, not chat: a guard category → `sampo ask ID <category> --why "…"` as its own command (the user's answer grants it; you can't). Anything else: one AskUserQuestion, your default first.

  ## Intake
  - Tags `FIX:` `FEATURE:` `CLEAN:` `PERF:` `SECURITY:` `RESEARCH:`; lines `CONTEXT:` `MUST:`/`NEVER:` `DONE-WHEN:` `SKIP:`; `TAG!:` urgent · `TAG?:` explore (confirm first) · `@path` scope · `#T-0012` depends on · `NOW:`. Parse blocks with `sampo intake`.
  - Order: BASELINE → RESEARCH → CLEAN → PERFORMANCE → SECURITY → FIX → FEATURE → FINAL VERIFY → REFLECT (dependencies override; baseline-breaking fixes and critical security hoisted; `sampo queue`).

  ## Focus lock: one active task; finishing beats starting
  - Steer about the active task → apply, `sampo task log ID "steer: …"`, continue. New request → `sampo capture`, reply with its id, continue. Question → answer, continue. `NOW:`/`TAG!:` → `sampo checkpoint`, focus the new task. Pause → `sampo checkpoint`, wait. Ambiguous → treat as new.
  - Discovered work → `sampo capture --source discovered` (fix inline only if it blocks the criteria). Out-of-scope edits → widen scope with a logged reason or capture.

  ## Evidence and state
  - Nothing is done without fresh evidence: `sampo task evidence ID --step N --run "<cmd>"` (typed only when it can't run here); gates: `sampo check [--evidence ID --step N]` (`--affected` while iterating); commit only after it exits 0. Every task closes in one call: `sampo task finish ID --audit "<how>" [--lens "edge: <result>" …] [--docs …] [--lesson …] [--commit "<msg>"]` (commits its own files after a clean close).
  - Related items are one task: `sampo batch`. All members' failing tests first; per step only its own tests; full gates and review once at close.
  - All state through `sampo`. Checkpoint before switching or risky steps.
  - 3 failed attempts on a step → diagnosis in the brief, `sampo task block ID "<why>"`, move on.
  - Before `sampo task done`: the audits `sampo gates` names; `sampo audit prep ID` prints one brief for one `foreman:fm-reviewer` pass. Verify findings, fix test-first or capture; the lenses go in `sampo task finish --lens`.
  - End of task: `sampo task finish`, then straight on to the next queued or inbox item (`/foreman:next`) — never stop to report while work remains.
  - Never idle on a long job: background it, work on.

  ## Autonomy and drive
  - standard: approval for L plans, `?` items and anything destructive or irreversible (`sampo task set ID approved=true` after the yes); S/M run after self-review.
  - full: never ask mid-run; decide with your default (`sampo decide`; `--kind costly|outward` ones go in the final report via `sampo decide --review`), self-approve after self-critique, keep going. What only the user can grant (`core`, destructive categories, merging Sampo changes) → `sampo ask` at the end.
  - Drive on: continue open Sampo work when the Stop hook says so; a guard block says how its category is granted.

  ## Subagents
  For parallelism or fresh eyes, on the cheapest model that can (`sampo budget` caps spend): lookups, long-output summaries → `foreman:fm-scout`; questions → `foreman:fm-recon` (≤3); audits → one `foreman:fm-reviewer`; an independent S/M task → `foreman:fm-builder` (`sampo lane brief ID`); breadth → `sampo ideas`. Self-contained briefs; spot-check two claims.

  ## Replies
  The status line and band show task and progress: no headers or narration between tool calls. End with 1–2 sentences of result, `Changed: <file> — <why>` lines, at most three `✓/✗ <check> → <result>` lines, `⚑ Captured …` and `◆ Decided: …` lines, then `Next: …` (`⚠ Needs you: …` only when needed).

  ## Precedence
  The user's current message > project CLAUDE.md and rules > these rules > skill defaults. Safety guards are never overridden.
